        <h1>Interest
in IT </h1>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve always found technology to be interesting. I find it interesting because of what more it can become in the future and how it can help with simple and hard activities. My interest sparked when a friend of mine wanted to start a business which was based online. I chose to study in RMIT (Online) because most of the people I know have graduated or is currently studying in RMIT and it is a potential University that I would like to be with. I expect to learn and experience the broad world of IT but more to do with how to handle technology.<b> </b></p>

        <p>Personally, what is appealing to me in this advertisement is the job itself, I aim to be a web developer when I have enough experience and potentially earn as much as advertised. The job requires experience for 2 years programming in PHP and experience in Lavarel or Symphony then HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am yet to learn and experience these requirements although I have some time of experience with HTML. I plan to learn as much as I can from my current courses which is Intro to IT and Intro to Programming and courses I will take in the future. I also plan to learn coding in my own time by using <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com/">www.CodeAcademy.com</a> and other ways to enhance my experience and learning ability. </p>

        <p>Before doing this type of test I already had an idea of how I am as a person and most of the results I&rsquo;ve found here just confirms or adds the percentage that I am more likely what I thought I was. Personally, I find that these results are of benefit to me and my team, I could use the results to find out more in how I can be more useful in a work or team environment or vice versa. With 16personalities.com they provide other personality types that could be a match to work together in a work environment which is useful when forming a team with the matching personality type. </p>
        <h2>Project Idea </h2>
        <p>Overview &ndash; The project will be a mobile app that uses the phones processors to mine data like how bitcoin (cyptocurrency) is produced but gives the users digital characters that might be of value in terms of money and the owner of the app gets the virtual coin the users produced. </p>
        <p>Motivation &ndash; The motivation for this project is the NFT Art. Essentially the NFT (Non-Fungible token) Digital Art is becoming more like the stock market where people create digital art and sell them giving the clients full ownership of the digital art which could rise in value if the art gains recognition. NFT Digital Art that are popular today have been known to sold for more than $3,000 on average. </p>
        <h2>Description  </h2>
        <p>One of the goals of this project is to take advantage of inactive phone devices and put into use, the application could be running in the background whilst it&rsquo;s charging and still mining virtual coins. The main goal is to attract revenue by using virtual characters as a reward for mining virtual coins for the company and that these virtual characters could potentially be sold in the market to be made with the application. The rarity of the virtual characters will determine its value and not how much the user has mined. </p>
        <h2>Tools and technologies  </h2>
        <p>The tools needed for this project will be a computer to design the application and android phones for testing and finding out how much the phone can handle. As for standard when it comes to programming coding will be needed as a tool. </p>
        <h2>Skills
Required  </h2>
        <p><!--[if !supportLists]-->&bull;      <!--[endif]-->A Software Engineer will be needed for designing and developing the effectiveness of the application. </p>
        <p><!--[if !supportLists]-->&bull;      <!--[endif]-->A digital art designer to design and create characters that will show appealing to users.  </p>
        <p><!--[if !supportLists]-->&bull;      <!--[endif]-->An interface designer to design the interface of the application. </p>
        <p><!--[if !supportLists]-->&bull;      <!--[endif]-->General programmer to program implications. </p>
        <p>As with the general making of mobile applications the common skills needed for these types of projects are C, C++, Python, or Java. Finding people with these skills won&rsquo;t be hard, it&rsquo;s a matter of budget to acquire people with these skills and devices needed for the project like phones for testing. </p>
        <p><b>Outcome</b> </p>
        <p>If the project is successful in terms of working programs and such it will then be advertised to the public to be in use to make income or attract potential long-term collectors of the digital characters to be produced within the app and if the project is successful financially it can lead to bigger things such as employing more creative digital artist to create digital characters and employing more voices in the Programming/IT community. The basic impact of this development would be to create value out of digital characters made from this app making it unique and creating possible income for daily users.&nbsp;</p>
